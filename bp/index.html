          <p>To quote the [[DWBP]], there is a growing interest in publishing and consuming data on the Web. Very often the common factor across multiple datasets is the location data. Spatial data, or data related to a specific location, is what this Best Practice is all about. </p>
          <p>There's already a lot of spatial data on the web. Everone knows the maps, satellite and street level images offered by search engines. There are many nice examples of spatial data being used in web applications. </p>
          <aside class="example"><a href="http://sfpark.org/">SF Park</a> is a website where users can look on a map of San Francisco to see where parking is available and at what price.

        <section id="intro-principles">
        <h3>Principles</h3>
          <p>We will not reinvent; the best practices in this document are based on what is already there. The added value is that they are assembled here.</p>
          <p>The last thing we want is for this to become a 'best theories' document. This Best Practices document takes its examples and solutions from what is being done in practice right now. In other words, it is as much as possible evidence based. This document will also describe 'emerging practices' when no established solutions can be found in practice yet. Best versus emerging practices will be clearly recognizable in this document.</p>
          <p>This document complies as much as possible with the principles of the [[LD-BP]] and the (developing) [[DWBP]]. Where it does not, this will be identified and explained.</p>
          <p>Best practices have to be visible. This means: We will link to at least one (or two, three) publicly available example(s) of a non-toy dataset that follows the best practice.</p>
          <p>There should be many (small) examples in the Best Practices, as examples can be a good way of communicating an idea and are a good way to start an implementation.</p>
          <p class="note">The Principles section is mainly written for the Spatial Data on the Web working group itself; this section will be removed from this document. Some of the text might go into other sections.  </p>

    <section id="audience" class="informative">
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>The introduction makes clear that we have multiple groups of potential users in mind with this document. One of these groups is the geospatial expert, and another is the Web developer with no specific geospatial expertise. The first group can work with <abbr title="Web Feature Service">WFS</abbr>; the second are better served with simpler interfaces in a more 'Webby' fashion. The audience is the broadest community of Web users possible, application and tool builders addressing the needs to the mass consumer market should find value and guidance in the document. </p>
        
      <section id="audience-geospatial-experts">
        <h3>Geospatial experts without Web knowledge</h3>
        <p>They are vital in liberating existing spatial data, already published but not visible or linkable.</p>
      </section>
        
      <section id="audience-web-developers">
        <h3>Web developers without geospatial knowledge</h3>
        <p>An aim of this document is to make it easy for non-experts to work with (find, publish, use) spatial data on the Web. Web application developers who just (!) want to use spatial data should not need to become GIS experts; spatial data is just one facet of the information space they work with, so let's not make it special by requiring up front knowledge.</p>

      <section id="audience-content-publishers">
        <h3>Content publishers</h3>
        <p>The first two audience groups mentioned are user types; but spatial data publishers are a third important audience for this document. They want to know how to publish their spatial data in order for it to get used to its full potential.

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document is about spatial data on the Web. Practices about publishing data in general on the Web are out of scope.

      <p>Spatial data can be data that has an explicit geometry as a property, but this is not necessarily the case. Data about a place is spatial data even if no explicit geometry can be given for this place. </p>
      <p>Aspects that are out of scope for this document: </p>

                <li>A lighthouse is a real world thing, a feature is an information record about the thing, but often in current practice has properties that are about the real thing (e.g. height) and properties about the information record (e.g. last modified). The features are in a dataset, the dataset has an id and the features have a local id. So currently you cannot link to them; the features need to have http URI identifiers instead.

            <li>in order for identifiers to be useful, people should be comfortable creating them themselves (bottom up, like hashtags) and this BP will give some pointers about how to create good URIs (should be dereferenceable/resolvable). There is no top down authority that you have to go to in order to create identifiers for spatial objects. So just make them up yourself if you need them and they don't exist.</li>
            <li>how to mint the identifier yourself based on the features in your dataset and how the identifier is for the real 
              world thing the feature describes. Local names are not typically URIs. We know we want to use URIs as identifiers. So we might take the dataset URI -
              which identifies a silo ... think of a different dataset, this one about shipwrecks near lighthouses. But problem is mapping the local IDs, we want to

            objects from different datasets. You might determine that two datasets are talking about the same places and then can use spatial correlation,
            but this is often not enough. There is also danger in doing so (we need to expand on this - what's the danger?). Then there's the question of
            using sameAs or e.g. skos mapping relations like skos:related etc. The matter of reconciliation between thematic things or properties is one that
            we will not address. I.e. in this best practice we only give guidance on spatial reconciliation 
            (e.g. two mentions of Paris are talking about the same place), and are not addressing thematic reconciliation. </p>

        <h3>Expressing spatial data</h3>
        <p>It is important to publish your spatial data with clear semantics. The primary use case for this is you already have a database of assets and you want to publish the semantics of this data. Another use case is someone wanting to publish some information wich has a spatial component on the web in a form that search engines will understand. </p>
       
        
        <p>The spatial thing itself and its geometry property also has semantics. We may describe that here or in the Expressing geo section. </p>
        <p>How should I publish my vocabulary? This question is answered in the [[LD-BP]] document. We recommend that you link your own vocabulary to commonly used existing ones because it increases its usefulness. How to do this is out of scope for this document; however, we give some examples of mapping relations you can use from OWL, SKOS, RDFS. And we do the mapping between some commonly used spatial vocabularies. </p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>The current list of RDF vocabularies / OWL ontologies for spatial data being considered by the SDW WG are provided below. Some of these will be used in examples. Full details, including mapping between vocabularies, will be published in a complementary NOTE [tbd].</p>

            <p>Links enable a network of related resources to be connected together. For those connections to remain useful over a long period of time, both origin and target resources need to have durable identifiers. Typically, it is the spatial Things that are given durable identifiers (see <a href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 1: Use globally unique identifiers for entity-level resources</a>) whereas the information resources that describe them (e.g. geometry objects) may be replaced by new versions.</p>

        <h3>Enabling discovery</h3>
        <p style="background-color:yellow">This section is about <em>using</em> links for discovery, whereas <a href="#bp-linking" class="sectionRef"></a> is concerned with <em>creating</em> links.</p>
        <p>SDIs only allow discovery at the dataset level but not at the data level (the spatial things and their properties), which is wat we want. Metadata on both the dataset and the data level are useful, and we recommend not to keep them separate (like in an SDI) but together. </p>
        <p>The current OGC WxS services need some form of redesign (perhaps in the form of an extra layer on top aka a shim) in order to make it more discoverable and the data inside linkable. I.e. make crawlable pages to improve discovery. </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="35">The Data on the Web Best Practice is addressing discovery at the dataset level including spatial and temporal coverage.</p>
        <p>GeoDCAT-AP is a spatial extension to DCAT [[vocab-dcat]] which can help improve discovery of datasets. (see also <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/issues/35">ISSUE 35</a>).</p>
        <p>One way of discovering is browsing through data using semantics; which allows you to find related data through semantic similarity.</p>
        <p>Linksets are useful for making links between entities in the dataset discoverable and crawlable. Using linksets are one example of doing that at the dataset level, a third party making collections of links browsable and allowing discovery of backlinks.  Note that this is an emerging practice, not an established one.  Also address here: how do you deal with maintaining links over time (when resources you link to may change or disappear). Example: OpenPHACTS. </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="36">This needs further discussion. Linksets does not seem to be an evidence-based best practice. It might be an emerging practice; CSIRO example. This might go in a shared note with the DWBP. An example of expressing a collection of links from the library community is <a href="https://gbv.github.io/beaconspec/beacon.html">here</a>. An example vocabulary for expressing link sets is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/void/#describing-linksets">in VoID</a>.</p>
        <p>Datacubes can have a dimension which is a place name from a gazetteer and this allows the discovery of thematic data about a place.</p>
        <p>Some data is behind a paywall or security because of privacy. Metadata for such datasets should be published in a way that it is crawlable even though the data itself is not within reach of the crawler. There are practices existing for this; the SDWBP will point to them.</p>

        <p class="note">Dataset-level discovery is covered by DWBP <span style="background-color:yellow">[ref?]</span>; <em>spatial</em> data is typically more structured and contains Things that can be discovered individually</p>
