      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <section id="intro-general">
        <h3>General introduction</h3>
          <p>To quote the [[DWBP]], there is a growing interest in publishing and consuming data on the Web. Very often the common factor across multiple datasets is the location data. Spatial data, or data related to a location, is what this Best Practice document is all about. </p>
          <p>It's not that there is a lack of geospatial data on the Web, but the data that has been published is difficult to find and often problematic to access for non-specialist users. The key problems we are try to solve in this document are discoverability and accessibility, and our overarching goal is to bring publishing geospatial data into the web mainstream as a mechanism for solving these twin problems.</p>
          <p>There's already a lot of spatial data on the Web. The maps, satellite and street level images offered by search engines are familiar and there are many more nice examples of spatial data being used in Web applications. </p>
          <aside class="example"><a href="http://sfpark.org/">SFpark</a> is a Web site where users can look at a map of San Francisco to see where parking is available and at what price. Parking prices are incrementally raised or lowered in SFpark pilot areas based on demand. In this application, static data on existing parking spaces is combined with changing data about where people park the most, which is measured by parking sensors. </aside>
          <p>Different groups of people have a need for spatial data on the Web. </p>
          <p><em>Commercial operators, including search engines</em>, invest a great deal of time and effort in generating geographical databases which are mirrors to Web content with the geographical context often added manually or at best semi-automatically. This process would be substantially aided if data were published on the Web with the appropriate geographic information at the source, thus allowing discovery and access using the standard mechanisms of the Web.</p>
          <p><em>Geospatial experts</em> who try to find and use data published in <abbr title="Spatial Data Infrastructure">SDI</abbr>s, can get frustrated by the fact that most web services available for spatial data are in fact <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms"><abbr title="Web Mapping Service">WMS</abbr></a> services, which serve static pictures, not data. <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs"><abbr title="Web Feature Service">WFS</abbr></a> services, which allow you to get data, also exist, but are far less common. One could ask: do we really have a spatial data infrastructure or is it mostly just a 'spatial picture infrastructure'? </p>
          <p class="note">If you're not a geospatial expert, this may be the first time you've heard terms like SDI, WMS and WFS. But in fact, there is a whole world of geospatial standards, maintained by the <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr>, aimed at publishing geospatial data in a related series of standardized Web services and processing it with specialized tools. These standards have a steep learning curve.</p>
          <p>The intended users of the SDI are experts in the geospatial domain. The <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> standards cover the full range of geospatial use cases – some of which are very complex. Because of this, it requires significant expertise in geospatial information technology to be able to use the SDI.</p>
          <p>For <em>Web developers</em>, who come from outside the geospatial domain, the data behind the OGC services is part of the “Deep Web” - the data is published behind specialized Web services and is not easy to get at, unless you're an expert. But Web developers are increasingly creating and using data related to locations, so they are an important factor for geospatial data.</p>
          <p>The <em>public sector</em> creates a lot of geospatial data, much of which is open and can be useful to others who may or may not be geospatial data experts. This includes statistical data, for example regions identified by NUTS codes used as territorial units for statistics by the European Union. Spatial data often has a temporal component; things move, and boundaries change over time. Geospatial data is becoming more and more important for the Web and its importance is still growing, among other things because of the rise of the Internet of Things. The importance of spatial data is far beyond serving static ‘pixels’. Semantically meaningful information about objects is required. </p>
          <p>In short, there is a large demand for spatial data on the Web. But there are some questions around publishing spatial data on the Web that keep popping up and need to be answered. One is that many relevant standards already exist. These include informal 'community standards' - geospatial formats and/or vocabularies that enjoy widespread adoption (GeoJSON being the prime example [[GeoJSON]]) - and others for which the formal standardization process has not been completed. Where standards have been completed there are competing ideas and engineers are often unsure which ones to adopt. With these factors in mind, this Best Practice  document aims to clarify and formalize the relevant standards landscape.</p>
          <p>The best practices we describe in this document are different to how a typical SDI works; we've adopted a Linked Data approach as the underlying principle of the best practices, although not all of them require the use of Linked Data standards. </p>
          <p>Questions answered in this document include: how spatial information can best be integrated with other data on the Web; how machines and people can discover that different facts in different datasets relate to the same place, especially when 'place' is expressed in different ways and at different levels of granularity; how spatial aspects of metadata can be provided; how to express temporal properties; how to publish environmental monitoring data, such as sensor output, with sufficient context to unambiguously interpret the values, and many other things.</p>
          <p>The best practices in this document are based on what is already there. It is not meant to be a 'best theories' document: it takes its examples and solutions from what is being done in practice right now. The examples point to publicly available non-toy datasets. In other words, this document is as much as possible evidence based. In addition, this document may describe 'emerging practices' when no established solutions can be found in practice yet. </p>
          <p>The best practices in this document are designed to be testable by humans and/or machines in order to determine whether you are following them or not. They are predicated on using the Web as a data sharing platform [WEBARCH]. </p>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>The introduction makes clear that we have multiple groups of potential users in mind with this document. One of these groups is the geospatial expert, and another is the Web developer with no specific geospatial expertise. The first group can work with <abbr title="Web Feature Service">WFS</abbr>; the second are better served with simpler interfaces in a more 'Webby' fashion. The audience is the broadest community of Web users possible, application and tool builders addressing the needs to the mass consumer market should find value and guidance in the document. </p>

        <p>An aim of this document is to make it easy for non-experts to work with (find, publish, use) spatial data on the Web. Web application developers who just (!) want to use spatial data should not need to become GIS experts; spatial data is just one facet of the information space they work with, so let's not make it special by requiring up front knowledge.</p>

        <h3>Content publishers</h3>

    </section>

    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document extends the scope of the [[DWBP]] to consider spatial data, including sensor data and observation data. Spatial data is typically well structured and describes sets (or streams) of (spatial) Things. Unlike the [[DWBP]], which focuses on dataset and distribution, SDW focuses on exposing the individual; the entities, the spatial things, within a spatial dataset.</p>
      <p>In order to delimit the scope and elicit the required features for Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices, the SDW working group compiled a set of use cases [[UCR]] that represent scenarios of how spatial data is commonly published on the Web and how it is used. The set of requirements derived from these use cases were used to guide the development of the best practices.</p>
      <p>This document is about spatial data on the Web. Practices about publishing data in general on the Web are out of scope. Sometimes they are mentioned in this document and general examples are given, together with references to relevant resources about publishing data on the Web in general. </p>
      <p>Spatial data can be data that has an explicit geometry as a property, but this is not necessarily the case. Data about a place is spatial data even if no explicit geometry can be given for this place. Also, not all spatial data is geographic; for example, microscopy [see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#TCGAMicroscopyImaging">use case 40: TCGA / Microscopy Imaging</a>. </p>
      <p>Aspects that are out of scope for this document: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Best practices about publishing data in general on the Web;</li>
        <li>Best practices for displaying spatial data on maps;</li>
        <li>To discuss who has authority to mint URIs;</li>
        <li>Best practices about applying thematic semantics to data;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The main focus of this document will be on best practices that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are specifically relevant to spatial data published on the Web;</li>
        <li>encourage publication and/or re-use of spatial data (datasets and data streams) on the Web;</li>
        <li>can be tested by machines and/or data consumers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It should be noted that whether a best practice has or has not been followed should be judged based on the intended outcome, and not the possible approach to implementation which is offered as guidance. The best practices are subject to improvement as the technology and practices evolve and enhance. </p>

        <h3>Assigning identifiers to real world things and information resources</h3>
        <p>In the geospatial community, the entities within datasets are usually information resources, representing areas on a map, which in turn represent real world things. These information resources are usually called 'features'. A feature is a representation of a real world thing and there could be, and often are, more than one feature representing a real world thing. A feature often has, as a property, a geometry which describes the location of the feature.</p>
        <p>For example, a lighthouse is a real world thing, a feature is an information record about the thing, but often in current practice has properties that are about the real thing (e.g. height) and properties about the information record (e.g. last modified). There could be several features, in different datasets, that refer to the same lighthouse; one dataset has its location and date it was built, another has data about shipwrecks near the same lighthouse.</p>
        <p>Mostly, people looking for information are interested in real world things, not in information resources. This means the real world things should get global identifiers so they can be found and referenced. In addition, the features and their map representations - geometries and topologies - should have global identifiers so they can be referenced as well, and must be if they are managed elsewhere.</p>
        <div class="practice">
          <p><span id="globally-unique-ids" class="practicelab">Use globally unique identifiers for entity-level resources</span></p>
          <p class="practicedesc">Entities within datasets should have unique, persistent identifiers.</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>A lot of spatial data is available 'via the web' - but not really 'on the web': you can download datasets, or view, query and download data via web services, but it is usually not possible to reference an entity within a dataset, like you would a web page. If this were possible, spatial data would be much easier to reuse and to integrate with other data on the web.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>Entities (Spatial Things) described in a dataset will each be identified using a globally unique identifier such as a HTTP URI so that a given entity can be unambiguously identified in statements that refer to that entity.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>In order for identifiers to be useful, people should be comfortable creating them themselves (bottom up, like hashtags). Good identifiers for data on the web should be dereferenceable/resolvable, which makes it a good idea to use HTTP URIs as identifers. There is no top down authority that you have to go to in order to create such identifiers for spatial objects. So just make them up yourself if you need them and they don't exist. Read [[DWBP]] <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 11: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a> for general discussion on why persistent URIs should be used as identifiers for data entities. Using URIs means the data can be linked to using standard Web mechanisms; making them persistent means the links won't get broken. Note that ideally the URIs should resolve, however, they have value as globally scoped variables whether they resolve or not.</p>
            <p>For guidance about how to create persistent URIs, read [[DWBP]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers</a>. Keep in mind not to use service endpoint URLs, as these are usually dependent on technology, implementation, and/or API version and will probably change when the implementation changes.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>In general, re-using identifers for well-known resources is a good idea, because it prevents having an abundance of copies and much doubt regarding the authenticity of the information. Linking your own resources to well-known or authoritative resources also makes relationships between your data and other data, which refers to the same well-known resource, discoverable. The result is a network of related resources using the identifiers for the Things.</p>
            <p>In the case of Spatial Things, a simple way of indicating a location is by referencing an already existing named place resource on the Web. For example, DBPedia and GeoNames are existing datasets with well-known spatial resources, i.e. besides place names and a lot of other information, a set of coordinates is also available for the resources in these datasets. The advantage of referring to these named place resources is that it makes clear that different resources which refer to, for example, http://dbpedia.org/page/Utrecht, are all referring to the same city. If these resources would not use a URI reference but a literal value “Utrecht” this could mean the province Utrecht, the city Utrecht (both places in the Netherlands), the South African town called Utrecht, or maybe something else entirely. </p>

            <p>dbPedia and GeoNames are examples of popular, community-driven resource collections.

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>There are many mechanisms to reconcile (i.e. map/link) objects from different datasets. When two spatial datasets contain geometries, you can use spatial functions to find out which objects overlap, touch, etc. Based on this spatial correlation you might determine that two datasets are talking about the same places, but this is often not enough. For reasons of efficiency or simply for being able to use these spatial correlations in a context where spatial functions are not available, it is a good idea to express these spatial relationships in your data. There is also danger in relying on spatial correlation alone; you might conclude that two resources represent the same thing when in reality they represent, for example, a shop at ground level and living appartment above it.</p>
            <p>So, the idea is: if you want to link two spatial datasets, find out if they have corresponding geometries using spatial functions; and express these correspondances as explicit relationships.</p>

            <p>Spatial things can change in different ways, and sometimes the change is such that it's debatable if it's still the same thing. Think carefully about the life cycle of the spatial things in your care, and be reluctant about assigning new identifiers. A lake that became smaller or bigger is generally still the same lake. </p>
            <p>If your resources are versioned, a possible solution is to provide a canonical, versionless URL for your resource, as well as date-stamped versions. </p>

        <h3>Expressing spatial data</h3>
        <p>It is important to publish your spatial data with clear semantics. The primary use case for this is you already have a database of assets and you want to publish the semantics of this data. Another use case is someone wanting to publish some information wich has a spatial component on the web in a form that search engines will understand. </p>
       
        
        <p>The spatial thing itself and its geometry property also has semantics. We may describe that here or in the Expressing geo section. </p>
        <p>How should I publish my vocabulary? This question is answered in the [[LD-BP]] document. We recommend that you link your own vocabulary to commonly used existing ones because it increases its usefulness. How to do this is out of scope for this document; however, we give some examples of mapping relations you can use from OWL, SKOS, RDFS. And we do the mapping between some commonly used spatial vocabularies. </p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>The current list of RDF vocabularies / OWL ontologies for spatial data being considered by the SDW WG are provided below. Some of these will be used in examples. Full details, including mapping between vocabularies, will be published in a complementary NOTE [tbd].</p>

                <li>the choice of CRS is sensitive to the intended domain of application for the geospatial data - high precision applications (such as precision agriculture and defence) require spatial referencing to be accurate to a few metres or even centimetres</li>
                <li>[note: the misuse of spatial data can result in catastrophic results … both the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during the Balkan conflict and fatal incidents along the East Timor boarder are attributable spatial referencing problems]</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS84</a> is a common choice of CRS - although this in itself is ambiguous: we need to assert whether data relates to the ellipsoid (datum surface) or the geoid (gravitational equipotential surface; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM96">EGM96</a>). WGS84 is a reasonable choice for many human-scale activities (e.g. navigation). However, given that the earth’s surface is constantly moving (e.g. Australia moves by 7cm per year), WGS84 is not appropriate for precision applications. For example, the defence community use 12 separate mercator projections to maintain accuracy around the globe whilst Australia is moving to a dynamic datum.</li>
                <li>for convenience, the CRS is often designated within the data format or vocabulary specification (e.g. <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos">W3C WGS84 Geo Positioning vocabulary</a>) and, therefore, does not appear in the data itself. This is often considered as a default CRS. Data publishers and consumers should make sure they are aware of the specified CRS and any limitations that this may pose regarding the use of the data.</li>
                <li>where a specific CRS is required, the data publisher should choose a vocabulary where the CRS can be defined explicitly within the data</li>

          <h4>Publishing data with clear semantics</h4>

          <p>In most cases, the effective use of information resources requires understanding thematic concepts in addition to the spatial ones; “spatial” is just a facet of the broader information space. For example, when the Dutch Fireservice [<span style="background-color:yellow">ref?</span>] responded to an incident at a day care centre, they needed to evacuate the children. In this case, the <em>2nd</em> closest alternative day care centre was preferred because it was operated by the same organization as the one that was subject of the incident.</p>

          <p>This best practice document provides mechanisms for determining how places and locations are related - but determining the compatibility or validity of thematic data elements is beyond our scope; we’re not attempting to resolve the problem of ‘different views on the same/similar resources’</p>

        <h3>Enabling discovery</h3>
        <p style="background-color:yellow">This section is about <em>using</em> links for discovery, whereas <a href="#bp-linking" class="sectionRef"></a> is concerned with <em>creating</em> links.</p>
        <p>SDIs only allow discovery at the dataset level but not at the data level (the spatial things and their properties), which is wat we want. Metadata on both the dataset and the data level are useful, and we recommend not to keep them separate (like in an SDI) but together. </p>
        <p>The current OGC WxS services need some form of redesign (perhaps in the form of an extra layer on top aka a shim) in order to make it more discoverable and the data inside linkable. I.e. make crawlable pages to improve discovery. </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="35">The Data on the Web Best Practice is addressing discovery at the dataset level including spatial and temporal coverage.</p>
        <p>GeoDCAT-AP is a spatial extension to DCAT [[vocab-dcat]] which can help improve discovery of datasets. (see also <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/issues/35">ISSUE 35</a>).</p>
        <p>One way of discovering is browsing through data using semantics; which allows you to find related data through semantic similarity.</p>
        <p>Linksets are useful for making links between entities in the dataset discoverable and crawlable. Using linksets are one example of doing that at the dataset level, a third party making collections of links browsable and allowing discovery of backlinks.  Note that this is an emerging practice, not an established one.  Also address here: how do you deal with maintaining links over time (when resources you link to may change or disappear). Example: OpenPHACTS. </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="36">This needs further discussion. Linksets does not seem to be an evidence-based best practice. It might be an emerging practice; CSIRO example. This might go in a shared note with the DWBP. An example of expressing a collection of links from the library community is <a href="https://gbv.github.io/beaconspec/beacon.html">here</a>. An example vocabulary for expressing link sets is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/void/#describing-linksets">in VoID</a>.</p>
        <p>Datacubes can have a dimension which is a place name from a gazetteer and this allows the discovery of thematic data about a place.</p>
        <p>Some data is behind a paywall or security because of privacy. Metadata for such datasets should be published in a way that it is crawlable even though the data itself is not within reach of the crawler. There are practices existing for this; the SDWBP will point to them.</p>

        <div style="background-color:yellow">
          <ul>
            <li>current practice within SDI is to publish information (metadata records) about datasets within catalogues … these catalogue records are then indexed to help users find the dataset(s) that meets their needs and then signpost them to a service through which they can access the data itself … which may be as simple as providing a mechanism to download the entire dataset for local usage or provide a richer API to request only the requisite parts</li>
            <li>@eparsons: “it’s time to stop treating data as books” … where we have a catalogue card index for the library that helps you find the book, but not the Things that the books describe</li>
            <li>this 2-step approach to find desired information, e.g. search catalogue and then search the dataset, is suboptimal - the metadata in the catalogue may be neither accurate nor up to date, you cannot directly find the entities AND you will likely need to formulate a query in a given protocol in order to get data from the service endpoint</li>
            <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#metadata">Metadata</a>: <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#DescriptiveMetadata">Best Practice 2 Provide descriptive metadata</a> provides guidance on the information that may be provided at the dataset-level in order to assist discovery of the dataset or the service endpoint(s) from which the data can be accessed; e.g. using a catalogue
              <ul>
                <li>reference <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/139283/">GeoDCAT AP</a> that provide extensions to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT vocabulary</a> for describing spatial data</li>
                <li>dataset metadata <em>is</em> useful as it corresponds to the unit of governance for the data; e.g. license, ownership, maintenance regime etc. apply to the set and are applicable to each information entity within that set</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="note">Dataset-level discovery is covered by DWBP <span style="background-color:yellow">[ref?]</span>; <em>spatial</em> data is typically more structured and contains Things that can be discovered individually</p>

          <p>“pointy” APIs (with wide adoption; e.g. focused on simple point-based data) vs. specialist “expert” APIs … spatial data needs be simple to incorporate within a web environment … (or is it the APIs that need to be simple?)</p>

        <p>using an API that supports content negotiation when necessary.</p>
        <p>the URL for accessing a dataset does not equal a persistent identifier for the dataset itself.</p>
        <p>There's no best practice for exposing Web Feature Service content in a more accessible way from a linked data point of view. However we describe here a recommended way of doing it, giving each feature its own stable URI and extending the API to make it more discoverable.  </p>
        <p>The current OGC WxS services need some form of redesign (perhaps in the form of an extra layer on top aka a shim) in order to make it more discoverable and the data inside linkable. To make the data inside a service more linkable stable URIs need to be minted for the spatial things in the service and be made available. This would require modifications to the service itself. </p>

      <h2>Authoritative sources of geographic identifiers</h2>
      <p>As per <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html</a> item 4, it's useful for people to link their data to other related data. In this context we're most frequently talking about either Spatial Things and/or their geometry.</p>
      <p> There are many useful sets of identifiers for spatial things and which ones are most useful will depend on context. This involves discovering relevant URIs that you might want to connect to.</p>
      <p>Relevant URIs for spatial things can be found in many places. This list gives the first places you should check:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBpedia</a></li>
        <li>National open spatial datasets such as are made available by for example the UK and Dutch goverments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finding out which national open spatial datasets are available and how they can be accessed, currently requires prior knowledge in most cases, because these datasets are often not easily discoverable. Look for national dataportals / geoportals such as <a href="http://nationaalgeoregister.nl">Nationaal Georegister</a> (Dutch national register of geospatial datasets) or <a href="http://data.overheid.nl">Dataportaal van de Nederlandse overheid</a> (Dutch national governmental data portal). </p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>As an example, let's take Edinburgh. In some recent work with the Scottish Government, we have an identifier for the City of Edinburgh Council Area - i.e. the geographical area that Edinburgh City Council is responsible for:</p>
        
        <code>http://statistics.gov.scot/id/statistical-geography/S12000036</code>
        
        <p>(note that this URI doesn't resolve yet but it will in the next couple of months once the system goes properly live)</p>
        
        <p>The UK government provides an identifier for Edinburgh and/or information about it that we might want to link to:</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/S12000036">http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/S12000036</a></p> 
        
        <p>The Scottish identifier is directly based on this one, but the Scottish Government wanted the ability to create something dereferenceable, potentially with additional or different info to the data.gov.uk one. These two are owl:sameAs.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh"></a></p> 
        <p>DBpedia also includes a resource about Edinburgh. Relationship: "more or less the same as" but probably not the strict semantics of owl:sameAs.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81482">http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81482</a></p>
        <p>This Edinburgh resource is found by querying the OS gazetteer search service for 'Edinburgh' then checking the labels of the results that came up. OS give it a type of 'NamedPlace' and give it some coordinates.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81483">http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81483</a></p> 
        <p>This Edinburgh airport resource was also found by the same OS gazetteer search service for 'Edinburgh'.  This is clearly not the same as the original spatial thing, but you might want to say something like 'within' or 'hasAirport'.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000030505">http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000030505</a></p>
        <p>This resource is in the OS 'Boundary Line' service that contains administrative and statistical geography areas in the UK. It's probably safe to say the original identifier is owl:sameAs this one.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2650225/">http://sws.geonames.org/2650225/</a></p>
        <p>This is the Geonames resource for Edinburgh found using the search service: <code>http://api.geonames.org/search?name=Edinburgh&amp;type=rdf&amp;username=demo</code>
        Once you have found a place in geonames, there are other useful services to find things that are nearby. </p>
